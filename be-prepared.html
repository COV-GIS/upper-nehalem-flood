<h2>Be Flood Aware</h2>

<p>The Nehalem River and its larger tributaries have flooded many times and will flood again. Being aware of flood hazards and reminding family, friends and your new neighbor of the risk of flooding in the Upper Nehalem Valley is the first step in preparing the community.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://sage-meerkat-23394f.netlify.app/">Upper Nehalem Flood Map</a> to view flood hazard areas.</p>

<p>Don't live in a flood zone? You will still be impacted by flood events. During and after a flood you should expect power loss, inability of the City to produce water if you live in Vernonia, and disruption to transportation from washed out roads and bridges.</p>

<h2>Vernonia</h2>

<!-- <p>In February of 1996, Vernonia experienced the "flood to end all floods". It was considered at the time to be a once in several generations event. But just under 12 years later, in December 2007, Vernonia experienced an even larger flood, causing extensive damage to hundreds of homes and businesses. The State of Oregon and FEMA decided to invest tens of millions of dollars in flood recovery and mitigation to reduce flood risk for the community, as well as reduce the long term financial risk to federal and state agencies. All but a handful of effected homes were elevated. Substantially damaged properties were bought out and demolished. The school, health center, West Oregon Electric and our primary electric substation were moved out of the floodplain. The Cityâ€™s sewer lagoons where upgraded to avoid flood damage. Local authorities established better emergency preparedness and response. The City adopted, and enforces a robust Flood Hazard Reduction Ordinance. And it worked. In November of 2015, Vernonia experienced yet another major flood, however flood mitigation and community preparedness resulted in less than ten structures being flooded, and with minimal damage and loss relative to previous floods. Let's keep it up and be ready for the next one.</p> -->

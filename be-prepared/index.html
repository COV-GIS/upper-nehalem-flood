<h4>Be flood aware</h4>

<p>Low-lying areas of the Upper Nehalem Valley have flooded many times before and will flood again. Reminding family and friends at the beginning of flood season, or letting your new neighbor know about flood hazards, is the easiest way to be prepared as a community. Many new residents to the area have found themselves on the wrong side of flood waters by simply not being aware of the risk of flooding in the Upper Nehalem Valley. Even life long residents have been taken by surprise by high water events. Ignorance and complacency are the biggest threats to life and property from flooding.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="/map/">Upper Nehalem Flood Map</a> to view flood hazard areas.</p>

<p>Being aware of flood risks is of no use if you are not informed when a flood event is forecasted and/or inevitable. Here are several ways you can be alerted to potential flood events.</p>
